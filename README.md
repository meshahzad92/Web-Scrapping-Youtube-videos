# Web-Scraping-YouTube-Videos
In this project, I performed web scraping on YouTube using Selenium in Google Colab to extract and analyze video data. The scraped data is saved into a CSV file (yt_data.csv) for further analysis.

# Goal
This project focuses on scraping YouTube video data (such as video titles, views, and upload dates) using Selenium in Google Colab. By automating the extraction of video information, we can analyze trends, video popularity, and other metrics. The results are stored in a CSV file for further exploration, such as data analysis or visualization.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core language used for scripting.
Google Colab: Environment used for executing the Selenium script.
Selenium: Web scraping automation tool to interact with the YouTube website.
Google Chrome/ChromeDriver: Browser automation tool required by Selenium.
Pandas: For storing and manipulating the scraped data.
CSV: Format in which the scraped data is saved.
